## Introducton - needs

Needs foor NoSQL:

- Some specialists say that the "we" double the volume of data stored every year;
- "We" develop more and more apps with a non conventional behaviour;
- "We" have a demand for scalable applications.

The deficiencies of SQL databases make born the NoSQL databases.


## Differences between SQL and NoSQL

### Scalability

- In SQL databases is more related to a vertical scalability and NoSQL to a horizontal scalability (although obviousy NoSQL can also gain the benefits of vertical scalablity). There are cases of relational databases that have horizontal scalability also, like MySQL cluster, but this databases are related to data reading. The data sharing between replicas in a NoSQL scenario is named "`sharding`".
